# Circuit Representation and Simulation Project
This C program allows users to create a circuit representation using nodes or a linked list structure from a given Verilog file. The program supports various logic gates and can adapt its structure based on the input provided by the user.

# Features:
+ Circuit Representation: Create a circuit using nodes or linked lists from a Verilog file.
+ User Input: Provide inputs to the circuit and observe the corresponding outputs in specific nodes.
+ Simulation: Test all possible combinations of 0 and 1 for the circuit and observe the output for each combination.
+ Example Files: We have provided sample Verilog files, including a simple one and a complex one, for users to experiment with.

# How to Use:
+ Clone the Repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
+ Compile the Program: `gcc circuit_simulation.c -o circuit_simulation`
+ Run the Program: `./circuit_simulation input.verilog`
+ Follow On-screen Instructions: Enter inputs as prompted and observe the outputs.
